## Data Access

You can find your data at: <https://sldr.netlify.app/data/queensland-sharks.csv>

## Response Variable

Please fit a regression model using as your response variable: whether a shark was released alive.

## Context

These data were obtained from the [Queensland, Australia shark control program](https://www.data.qld.gov.au/dataset/bb4eda21-d85d-4782-803d-c67393fb2da9). Their description of the data reads:

>> The shark control program (SCP) relies on nets or drumlines, or a combination of both, to minimise the threat of shark attack on humans in particular locations. [The data contains] information on numbers and locations of sharks that have been caught by the SCP.

The data you will work with are from the year 2017. Variables in the dataset are:

- shark '`Species`
- `Date` when shark was caught
- `Area` where shark was caught
- `Location` where shark was caught (a subset of `Area`; a specific beach)
- `Latitude` where shark was caught
- `Longitude` where shark was caught
- `Fate` of shark: "Dead", "Euthanized" or "Released alive"
- `Length` of shark in meters
- `Water_Temp` where shark was found in degrees Celsius
- `Released_Alive` whether shark was released alive
- `Found_Dead` whether shark was found dead
