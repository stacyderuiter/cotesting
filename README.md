Collaborative statistics tests

This repo contains all the source material to generate and post two examples collaborative take-home statistics tests: one for an `applied-regression-test` and one for an `intro-stat-final` (materials found in the folders with those names).

At the GitHub Pages site for this repo (or in the docs folder of the repo), you can view example [instructions](https://stacyderuiter.github.io/cotesting/test-2-instructions.html) and [tests](https://stacyderuiter.github.io/cotesting/test2-Thirty.Student.html) (vary the number in the test URLs to see other examples).
