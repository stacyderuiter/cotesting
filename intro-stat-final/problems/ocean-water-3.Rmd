## Context

Data are from the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography $CO_2$  Program](https://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/seawater_carbon/ocean_time_series.html).  Variables measured include the total dissolved inorganic carbon (`DIC`, micromoles/kg) in sea water over time at three observation `Station`s, and as a function of `Depth,` (meters), `Salinity` (g/kg), and `Temp`erature (degrees Celsius). The variable `Decimal` gives the time of sample collection for each observation, in decimal years.

Observations have been collected at these three `Station`s at regular time intervals for many years.

## Variable for Question 1: `Salinity`

## Question and Variables for Part 2: Is there an association between the `Salinity` in seawater and the `Station` it came from?
